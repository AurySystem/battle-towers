### Tower Variants

#### Stone

Found in Forest, Plains, Swamps and Savannas, the *Stone Tower* is a homage to the 
original Battle Tower. You will find a mixed assortment of mobs as you climb to the top,
as well as previews of all the different biomes and areas you will discover on your adventure.

#### Frosted

Brr! The *Frosted Tower* will appear in any *Icy* biome, and looks strikingly
similar to the Ice Spikes it sometimes spawns near. While traveling to the top of a
Frosted Tower, you'll encounter various cold mobs and items. Don't forget to
bring a coat!

#### Sandy

The *Sandy Tower* can be found in any Desert biome, and is set apart due to the 
building around its base. Some Sandy Towers will appear as a sandcastle,
while others will take a form more similar to the Stone Tower. Sandy Towers also
draw similarities to Desert Temples due to their use of Red Sandstone.
